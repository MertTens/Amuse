# HOW TO GET MUSE CONNECTION TO WORK

1. Restart computer. 
2. Open terminal and navigate to `Amuse` project directory.
3. Activate the `museEnv` virtual environment.
4. Navigate to `minMuse` folder.
5. Type `sudo python3 live_plot.py` or whichever Muse-connected script you need.
6. Keep trying it until it works (the connection protocol is non-deterministic, at least on my IdeaPad S145 running Ubuntu)
