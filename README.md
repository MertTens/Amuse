# Amuse
*Scripts for the Mind over Music project*

The goal for this project is to create a feedback loop where EEG signals influence a musical instrument that in turn influences a simulated [SWIM](http://wearcam.org/swim/) (SWIMulator). This feedback loop can be adjusted to optimize flow state, concentration, mindfulness, or any other psychological characteristic we can extract from the muse headset. 

Goals for the project are as follows:
* (Done)Connect with the Muse
* (Done)Attain raw data from the Muse connection
* Process various psychological characteristics (flow state, concentration, etc.) from the raw EEG.
* Create a SWIMulator for virtual instruments.
* Set up a MIDI-controlled virtual synth that is parameterized by the EEG. 
* Test simulated feedback system.
* Expand and diversify visualization systems.
* Expand and diversify sound synthesis methods. 
* Investigate properties of final system(s) and present results.
